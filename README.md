# Test-Your-Reaction-Time-NEW-

# Purpose
The purpose of this game is to test how fast you can click the circles, in theory, testing your reaction time. As you click more circles, you'll see an additional slightly darker circle. This is where you use your quick thinking skills and click the original circle (the lighter one). If you click the darker one, the game ends. As your score goes up, the harder the game gets as the timer eventually decreases to a cap of 50. *RECOMMENDED TO USE A MOUSE AS IT IS EASIER*

# Challenges
The challenges I faced coding this game were trying to make sure the darker circle does not overlap with the original circle. As well, adding the timer was quite difficult which needed me to search it up on Youtube and ask my uncle for help. 

# Reflection
When making the game, I learnt many things I have previously forgot, due to the period of not coding for a bit, I needed to learn most things again when developing the game. What I learned that helped a lot however were how to manage game states and how to handle the random positoning/user interactions. This project alone improved my debugging skills as we had a lot of time for this project, that meant a lot of time to improve the game and figure out any errors. If I had some spare time, I would improve the game by learning how to add sound effects whenever you click the circle, some more challenges for players that think the game is too easy, and a leaderboard of everyone that played the game and how high their score is so there is competition and an urge to get a higher score.
